For example, if we were writing a larger piece of code, parser() as a function would be easier to manage rather than the code that executes the same behavior. This would make testing easier as well. We refer to this as <b>modularity</b>, which is especially important when working on teams. Modularity makes it easier for someone else to read, understand, use, and build upon our code.\n",
    "* They streamline our code and make it easier to maintain. Programmers reuse the same functions in multiple situations across a project. This means that they generalize the function as much as possible to maximize its usefulness. we call this process <b>abstraction</b>, which is an important part of reducing our code's complexity, especially for larger projects.\n",
